You can find the tutorial slides on unit testing on Moodle.
Further there is an example project covering jUnit4 and jUnit5 in depth showing you how to write unit tests available on Moodle 
in the Tipps and Tricks forum.
Note, the gradle configuration of this project is already configured correctly so that you can start writing
unit tests with jUnit4 and jUnit5 without any need to adapt the given gradle configuration. 
I would recommend that you add the tests in this folder (respect separation of responsability while doing so, i.e.,
create multiple packages, classes, and so on to store the unit tests).
